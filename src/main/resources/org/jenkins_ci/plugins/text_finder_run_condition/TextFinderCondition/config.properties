FilesToSearch=Files to Search
descFileSet=Specify the path to the files in which to search, relative to &lt;a href='ws/'>the workspace root&lt;/a>. This can use wildcards like 'logs/**/*/*.txt'. See &lt;a href='http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'> the @includes of Ant fileset&lt;/a> for the exact format. Leave this empty if you don't want to scan any files (usually combined with checked 'also search the console output'.)
descRegexp=Specify a regular expression using the syntax supported by the Java &lt;a href='http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html'>Pattern&lt;a> class.
